## Functionality

The Dragon Gold Forex Trading Robot is designed to automate trading in the Forex market. It uses a moving average crossover strategy to open and close positions.

### Import necessary libraries

The code imports the necessary libraries for trading and technical indicators.

### Define input parameters

The code defines the following input parameters:
- `lotSize`: Trading lot size
- `stopLoss`: Stop loss in pips
- `takeProfit`: Take profit in pips

### Define global variables

The code defines a global variable `ticket` to keep track of the trade ticket number.

### Initialize the trading robot

The `OnInit()` function is called when the trading robot is initialized. It prints an initialization message and returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED`.

### Start trading

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. It calculates the short and long moving averages using the `iMA()` function.

If there is no open position (`ticket == 0`), the code checks if the short moving average crosses above or below the long moving average. If the short moving average crosses above the long moving average, a new buy position is opened. If the short moving average crosses below the long moving average, a new sell position is opened.

If there is already an open position (`ticket != 0`), the code checks if the position is still open. If the position is closed, it prints a closing message and resets the `ticket` variable.

### Handle errors

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the trading robot is deinitialized. It prints a deinitialization message and the reason for deinitialization.
